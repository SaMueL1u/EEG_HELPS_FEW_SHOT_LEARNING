# EEG_HELPS_FEW_SHOT_LEARNING
The objective of few-shot learning is to quickly learn inference and classification with limited data samples, similar to how the human brain learns and forms new cognitive models with a small amount of observation and past experiences when facing novel things. Based on this, we know the process of visual information extraction in the human brain, using contrastive learning to extract patterns from cognitive images encoded in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The obtained feature extractor is then applied to few-shot image tasks. This approach provides a more generalizable method for few-shot tasks. It shows an average improvement of 7.3\% in Top-1 recall compared to performing few-shot image tasks in the original ProxyNCA framework. This provides a new technical route to improve the generalization of few-shot learning.
